- EDA (exploratory data analysis using pandas 
- Data visualisation by graphs 
### DATA PREPROCESSING
- feature scaling 
- data encoding 
-  train and tesyt data separation
### MACHINE LEARNING OR DEEP LEARNING
- Supervised- target data provided (regressiona nd classification)
- Unsupervised -no taget val , only predictive (clustering )
- semisupervised (some targert and somewithout target )
- Re inforcement learning 
### DEPLOYMENT OF MODEL 
- This predictive model is made and weights ad coef are assingned 
- converted into file form (.sav, .pkl)
- this file used in application as server by end user ie from backend this provide data )
- used in web , mobile or desktop applivation
